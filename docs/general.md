# Description of the WaCS team

## Research groups
We are in the [Waves in Complex Systems](https://inphyni.univ-cotedazur.eu/sites/wacs) *team* in the [Waves and quantum physics](https://inphyni.univ-cotedazur.eu/research/waves-and-quantum-physics) *axis* of the [Institut de Physique de Nice](https://inphyni.univ-cotedazur.eu) :smiley:

There are few research groups:
* Microwave group (*Fabrice*, Olivier, Ulle)

## Collaborations
We are collaborating with few other teams at INPHYNI
* Optical fiber and applications (Wilfried, Bernard)
* Complex photonic systems and materials (Nicolas, Aurélie)
* Quantum photonics and information (Laurent)

## Shared services and technology platforms
